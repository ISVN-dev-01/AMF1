# 🔍 GitHub Actions Failure Inspection Guide

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Log Investigation**

### **1. Access GitHub Actions Page**
```
🔗 URL: https://github.com/ISVN-dev-01/AMF1/actions
📍 Navigate to: Repository → Actions tab
🎯 Look for: Red ❌ or yellow ⚠️ status indicators
```

### **2. Identify the Failing Workflow Run**
```
📅 Most Recent Run: Check the commit "fix: Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues..."
🔍 Look for: "F1 ML Pipeline CI/CD" workflow
❌ Status: Failed jobs will show red X icons
```

### **3. Drill Down to Specific Job Failures**

Click on the failed workflow run, then look for these job statuses:

#### **Job 1: `test` (Multi-Python Matrix)**
- ✅ Python 3.8 - Success/Failure?
- ✅ Python 3.9 - Success/Failure?  
- ✅ Python 3.10 - Success/Failure?
- ✅ Python 3.11 - Success/Failure?

#### **Job 2: `model-training-test`**
- Model creation and validation

#### **Job 3: `api-integration-test`**
- API server startup and endpoint testing

#### **Job 4: `docker-build-test`**
- Docker container build and validation

#### **Job 5: `security-scan`**
- Security vulnerability scanning

## 🚨 **Common Failure Patterns to Look For**

### **A. Dependency Installation Failures**
```
❌ ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement lightgbm==4.1.0
❌ Failed building wheel for xgboost
❌ Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required
❌ clang: error: no such file or directory
```

**Root Cause**: Missing system dependencies or incompatible package versions
**Solution**: Update requirements.txt or add system packages to CI

### **B. Test Execution Failures**  
```
❌ FAILED tests/test_api.py::TestAPI::test_health_endpoint
❌ AssertionError: Expected 200, got 503
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'monitoring'
❌ FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'models/stage1_lgb_ensemble.pkl'
```

**Root Cause**: Missing test data, model files, or import issues
**Solution**: Fix test setup or model creation scripts

### **C. Network/Timeout Issues**
```
❌ requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected)
❌ curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000
❌ The operation was canceled (timeout after 30 seconds)
```

**Root Cause**: API server not starting or network connectivity issues
**Solution**: Increase timeouts or fix server startup

### **D. Permission/Environment Issues**
```
❌ Permission denied: '/github/workspace/models'
❌ GITHUB_TOKEN not found
❌ fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com'
```

**Root Cause**: File permissions or missing environment variables
**Solution**: Fix directory creation or add required secrets

## 📝 **Log Inspection Checklist**

### **Priority 1: Find the FIRST Error** 🎯
```
🔍 Look for the earliest failure in chronological order
📍 Usually in: "Install Python dependencies" or "Run [first test]" 
⚠️  Don't focus on final summary errors - find the root cause
```

### **Priority 2: Check Each Job Type**
```
✅ test job - Basic environment setup and unit tests
✅ model-training-test - Model creation and training pipeline  
✅ api-integration-test - API server and endpoint validation
✅ docker-build-test - Container build and runtime testing
✅ security-scan - Vulnerability scanning
```

### **Priority 3: Copy Key Error Messages**
```
📋 Copy the full stack trace of the first error
📋 Note which Python version failed (if matrix testing)
📋 Record which step in the job failed
📋 Save any relevant environment information
```

## 🛠️ **Most Likely Issues Based on Recent Changes**

### **1. LightGBM/XGBoost Installation** (90% probability)
```bash
# Expected error patterns:
ERROR: Failed building wheel for lightgbm
ERROR: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required
clang: error: command failed
```

**Why**: These packages require system compilers that may not be available in GitHub Actions Ubuntu environment.

### **2. Prometheus Client Missing** (70% probability)
```bash  
# Expected error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prometheus_client'
ImportError: cannot import name 'f1_monitor'
```

**Why**: API tries to import monitoring but prometheus-client may not install correctly.

### **3. Model File Creation** (60% probability)
```bash
# Expected error:
FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: 'models/stage1_lgb_ensemble.pkl'
AssertionError: Model file not created
```

**Why**: Test model creation script may fail in CI environment.

### **4. API Server Startup** (50% probability)
```bash
# Expected error:
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000
ConnectionError: API not responding
```

**Why**: FastAPI server may not start properly in CI background process.

## 🎯 **Action Items**

### **Immediate Steps:**
1. **🔗 Visit**: https://github.com/ISVN-dev-01/AMF1/actions
2. **📋 Click**: Most recent workflow run (commit: "fix: Resolve CI/CD pipeline issues...")
3. **🔍 Expand**: Each failed job (click the red ❌)
4. **📝 Copy**: First error message and full stack trace
5. **📨 Report**: Paste the error details here for specific fix

### **Common Quick Fixes:**
```yaml
# If LightGBM fails - add to CI workflow:
- name: Install LightGBM dependencies
  run: sudo apt-get install -y libomp-dev

# If XGBoost fails - pin version:
xgboost==2.0.3  # instead of 3.0.5

# If model files missing - check:
- python create_test_models.py  # runs successfully?
```

## 📞 **Next Steps**

**Please navigate to the GitHub Actions page and:**

1. **Copy the specific error message** from the first failing step
2. **Note which job failed** (test, model-training, api-integration, etc.)
3. **Identify the Python version** if it's a matrix build failure  
4. **Paste the full error details** here

**I'll then provide the exact fix** for your specific failure pattern! 🎯
