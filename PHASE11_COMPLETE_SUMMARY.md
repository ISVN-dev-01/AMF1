    # Deploy if overall improvement > 1%
    if improvement > 0.01:
        return True
    
    # Deploy if specific metrics show significant improvement
    stage1_improvement = old_performance['stage1_mae'] - new_performance['stage1_mae']
    stage2_improvement = new_performance['stage2_accuracy'] - old_performance['stage2_accuracy']
    
    if stage1_improvement > 0.002 or stage2_improvement > 0.02:
        return True
